(SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) as Length
FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) ASC, CITY ASC
LIMIT 1)

UNION

(SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) as Length
FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY ASC
LIMIT 1);

-- Here's what's happening in the query:

-- The first query in the parenthesis () is finding the city with the shortest name. 
-- It does this by ordering all cities by the length of their names in ascending order 
-- (LENGTH(CITY) ASC). If there are multiple cities with the shortest name, it then orders 
-- these by city name in ascending order (CITY ASC). The LIMIT 1 clause ensures that only 
-- one row - the one with the shortest name, alphabetically first in case of a tie - is returned.

-- The second query in the parenthesis () is doing the same thing but for the longest city name. 
-- It orders all cities by the length of their names in descending order (LENGTH(CITY) DESC), and 
-- if there are multiple cities with the longest name, it selects the one that comes first alphabetically 
-- (CITY ASC). Again, LIMIT 1 ensures that only one row is returned.

-- The UNION clause combines the results of the two queries into a single table.

-- Please note that the function to get the length of a string can vary depending on the database system.
--  In this answer, I've used LENGTH(), which works in MySQL and PostgreSQL, 
--  but in SQL Server, you would use LEN() instead.
